# JavaScript Challenge

# Running

open up index.html in your browser

## Concept

This javascript example shows a few event driven features.
* The first feature is when the window loads, a red box shows up.
* The second feature is clicking on the red box moves it to the right by 50px each time
* The third feature is when clicking on the "Roll Tide" link, it randomly generates a number between 5 & 5005, and puts the value into the readonly text field.
* The fourth feature is a doozy! Enter the famous konami code to see a surprise.

## Issues

None of my features work :(

## Goal

1. Fix syntax errors
2. Document functions
3. Enable all events
4. Use http://www.jslint.com/ to check for proper code
  * Note: Be sure to check "Assume a browser", "Tolerate missing 'use strict' pragma", "Tolerate messy white space"
  * Also Note: I don't expect 100% here, but it must scan the full document.

Hint: use the comments to help figure out what these things are supposed to do.


## Bonus

Add some cool stuff!
